Our app addresses food wastage by connecting canteens and hostels with old age homes and orphanages for surplus food redistribution. Canteens and hostels can post excess food availability, while orphanages and old age homes can request donations based on their needs. Through real-time notifications and location-based services, the app efficiently matches donors with recipients, ensuring timely delivery of surplus food. Features include updating food details managing food inventory, and tracking donations to enhance transparency. By leveraging technology for streamlined food redistribution, the app reduces waste and fosters communityÂ compassion.
